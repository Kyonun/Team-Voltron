/----------------------- DEPENDENCIES ---------------------------/
/****************************************************************/
This section shall cover what this project requires before
contributing to the project. The section also details how to
find and install the dependencies. 

---------------------{ Unity Installation }-----------------------

The Team Voltron Project uses the Unity Game Engine.

Download Link here: https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual

Choose "Personal" for the free option. After choosing your
option, you will be prompted if you are new or returning user.
After choosing your option, you will be prompted to read the
Terms of Service. After reading, click the checkbox and then
the Download Unity Hub option.

---------------------{ Version Installation }---------------------

The Team Voltron project uses Unity Version: 2019.2.7f2

To install Unity 2019.2.7f2 goto: 
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

Then, scroll down until you see the specified version. Click 
your favored download option for your specific platform. We 
recommend downloading directly through your Unity Hub, due to 
the ease and simplicity of the installation. 

If you select the Unity Hub option, your hub should pop up. 
Before installation can begin, you must select the builds that 
you want to support. Each build has their own specific platforms, 
such as Android support, PC support, Mac support, etc.

After selecting your specified builds click done, and the 
installation should begin automatically.

----------------------------{ WARNING }---------------------------
Do NOT, under any circumstances, update your Unity version. The 
project may not work properly if you do so. The project only 
supports the specified version above.
 

/****************************************************************/
/-------------------------- NAVIGATION --------------------------/
/****************************************************************/

This section shall describe what each folder/directory is
and what is their purpose. 

---------------------{ Demonstrations (Demos) }-------------------

The following folders are Demos for the Team Voltron Project:

	* Demo4
	* Demo4V2
	* Demo4V3
	* FP2

Demo4, Demo4V2, and Demo4V3 are the latest of our project 
demonstrations. The letter "V" with a following number represents 
what version it is, with the higher version number being the 
latest build.

FP2 is our latest functional prototype. 

-----------------------{ Main Project Folder }--------------------

Our main project folder is "Lightning Game", which was a working
title of our game "Knock Blocks". The folder contains the Unity 
project in which you can add directly to the Unity Hub. For
installation instructions, skip down to the Installation section
under the Installing the Main Project subsection. 

/****************************************************************/
/------------------------- INSTALLATION -------------------------/
/****************************************************************/

This section cover how to install the main project, along with
its subsequent builds and demos.

-------------------{ Installing the Main Project }-----------------

Before you can start on the project, you need to set it up
properly on the Unity Hub. To do this, just follow these steps

1) Open your Unity Hub.

2) There should be two buttons on the upper lefthand side of
    the application, "Add" and "New". Click on "Add".

3) Clicking "Add" will bring up a file explorer window. Use
    this window to navigate to your cloned project folder.

4) After opening the repository folder, "Team-Voltron", click on
    the main project folder, "Lightning Game".

5) Click the "Select Folder" button in the file explorer.

6) Your project should appear in the list under "Projects". Once
    you find your project, click on it to launch it.

Congratulations. You are now ready to contribute to the project.

-------------------------{ Installing Demos }------------------------

Installing demos is only a matter of cloning or downloading the
repository. The reason being that the demos are already in execut-
able form, meaning they are good to run as-is. Refer to the Naviga-
tion section for which folders contain Demos. 

-------------------------{ Building Demos }--------------------------

Demos are executables produced with the help of the Build feature 
in the Unity engine. To build follow these steps:

1) In the Unity window, click on the "File" tab to open a drop down.

2) There are two options at the very bottom: "Build Settings..." and
   "Build and Run". Build and Run will automatically build the game
    and run it. We don't want that!

3) Click on "Build Settings..."

4) A new window should appear. There are three containers in this
    window. A container that holds your scenes, another for which
    platform you would like to build for, and some other settings
    in a seperate container. For more information please visit
    the Unity website.
    
    Select the scenes and platform you would like to build for.
    
    Note: If you do not see a platform that you would like to build 
    for, then you may not have the right support module. To get the 
    right platform, read the Version Installation subsection, under 
    the dependencies section or visit the Unity website. 

5) Click on the Build option.

6) You will then have to choose a folder to store your build in. We
    recommend making new folder with your specified name.

   Warning: Be careful on which folder is selected. Unity will store
    all files necessary for the build in that folder.

7) Hit the Select Folder button. After a short load, Unity will build
    a .exe file with necessary support files.

   Warning: Do not remove any files, including the .exe, from the
    build folder. The build will not function if anything is missing.

Congratulations. You have built a demo.

-----------------------{ Running Demos }---------------------------

Demos are .exe files built by Unity. Usually these demos will come in
folders holding all the files necessary to run a demo. Running a demo
is as simple as clicking your mouse button twice. To run it just
follow these steps:

1) Open the folder containing the demo's .exe file. It should have a
    logo similar to Unity's logo.

2) Double click on the file with game's project name. In our case, it
    would be "Lightning Game".

3) The game should start, with the Unity logo covering the screen.

4) To exit from the game, if no exit button is found, simply press
    the Alt + F4 keys on your keyboard to hard exit from the program.
